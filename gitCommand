Code share: Git, CVS, SVN, ClearCase, VSS(Visual Studio)

Git:
pwd: show the location


-> git commit -m "add readme"

-> you can add three txt and just one commit

-> we add this sentence and use $ git status to check what happen

add hello, we want to know if git diff work

->git diff shows the difference

Attention, you change your file but if not add or commit on git, then they are not change in there.

You can review all the version you have commit, let's have a try with git log.

->git log: show all the version from most currently to most far away. Press q for done.

The current is HEAD, and the one before last one is HEAD^, HEAD^^. with git reset HEAD^.

->git reset --hard HEAD^             //the file will change to the previous one

How ever, if you want to change back the most recently one, you can do like this:

->git rest --hard 597914ec

597914ec is a ID of version. You can get through 

->git reflog

->cat filename                  //show the content of the file

Hi, I am planning to learn more. It is a tough time, but I can survive.
