Attention, you change your file but if not add or commit on git, then they are not change in there.

You can review all the version you have commit, let's have a try with git log.

->git log: show all the version from most currently to most far away. Press q for done.

The current is HEAD, and the one before last one is HEAD^, HEAD^^. with git reset HEAD^.

->git reset --hard HEAD^             //the file will change to the previous one

How ever, if you want to change back the most recently one, you can do like this:

->git rest --hard 597914ec

->cat gitCommand                    //show the content in the file
